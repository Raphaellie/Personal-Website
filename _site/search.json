    "text": "Focusing on American politics, I am particularly interested in how racial identities shape the way people perceive and respond to the political world, and to what extent such racialization of political behavior is responsible for affective polarization characterizing the American public. To answer these questions, I look into the role of racial imagery, that is, racialized imagination of politically relevant categories. I contend that given the prevalence of group-centrism in opinion formation, people approach an issue or a party not just through ideological concerns, but also by considering whether people at the center of the category looks racially like or unlike themselves. My research endeavors to understand how racial imagery of various issues affects people’s preferences, how this translates into ideological and affective divides along racial lines, and how varied strength of racial imagery can lend us insights into resolving racial polarization and building a healthier democracy."

While existing works look into experiential and cultural differences between the two groups, this study examines the role of whites’ excessive representation in police workforce that fosters a “white imagery” of the profession. Can this racialized image of police officers activate in-group favoritism among whites but push blacks away?\nMerging the 2020 Cooperative Election Study with administrative sampling of local police departments, I find that given whites’ share of local population constant, a higher percentage of white officers in local police department is associated with more favorable feelings of police among whites, a greater black-white divide in police attitudes, and makes the white residents more tolerant of police at the presence of police violence.\n\nPDF\nHTML\nGitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the Other Side: Local Party Images and Affective Polarization\n\nSocial sorting, the situation where social groups become strongly interconnected with political parties, has been examined as a contributing factor to affective polarization in American politics. By cultivating party images represented through prominent social identities, this process instills group tensions into party politics. Yet few existing studies takes advantage of local variations of partisan composition to investigate whether the extent to which current political polarization are affected by “parties in our head”.\nThis research builds an index for party images for each congressional district using 2016 and 2020 Cooperative Election Studies, and links these local measures with 2020 American Election Studies where detailed indicators of polarization behavior are included. I find that the further the racial images of local partisans deviate from national stereotypes, the lower level of affective polarization is observed among the district’s respondents. The deviation of local party images also undermines the influence group feelings have in people’s polarization behavior. Heterogeneities by party and racial group are discussed.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak the Party Images? The Electoral Impact of Minority Republican Candidates\n\nDominantly white as the GOP is for now, the overall diversification of the U.S. population leads to a historic number of minority Republicans running for and serving in federal offices. With the Republican Party still locked with white Americans and their racial resentment, how do the emergence of these minority Republicans in congressional races enter into voters’ perceptions and condition their vote choices as partisans? And further, how do their presence challenge the status quo of party-race alignments? Drawing upon respondent’s self-reported perception of their house candidates from 2010 to 2020, I find that the perception that the GOP candidate is non-white results in a reduction in party-line voting, a lessening of partisan rigidity, but also an eroding of electoral participation.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gloom over the Mind: Prussian Rule, Cultural Persistence, and Political Liberalism in Poland\n\nCoauthor with Weihan Zhang. An emerging literature looks to historical legacies when trying to understand contemporary political divides, yet specific mechanisms remain empirically unsettled through which past institutions continuously shape political behavior over generations. Cultural or psychological persistence, which precipitates from unique, individual experiences of past generations, is often entangled with more structural mechanisms like social and economic path dependence of past institutions, making the two hard to distinguish.\nExploiting Poland’s Prussian partition in history and territory transfers after WWII, this study differentiates out the cultural persistence mechanism through within-treatment comparison. Under a spatial regression discontinuity design, our results indicate overall stronger reluctance toward political and national conservatism in former Prussian area, even after considering socioeconomic covariates. Furthermore, such liberal legacies of historical Prussian rule concentrate only on areas that didn’t experienced substantial migration following WWII, cementing a cultural mechanism.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub"

Yet what is usually ignored or confused in this line of identity shift research is the temporal structure where politically motivated changing of identities takes place. It is one thing that long-time, consistent partisans alter their identities in accordance to prototypical partisans, and another when unstable party identifiers switch their group labels in order to match their changing politics. Building upon early insights from the American Voter, this study proposes a static-versus-dynamic framework of identity shift under political influence. I utilize a five-wave panel dataset to show that both kinds of identity shift exist among American partisans yet differ in terms of their magnitudes and the populations they impact.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub"

    "text": "American National Election Studies (ANES) is possibly the most authentic survey used in studies of American political behavior. Conducted every four years (and sometimes every two years) since 1948, ANES provides a consistent and enduring window for political scientists to observe both the cross-sectional landscape and time-serial evolution of public opinion. Though its name suggests electoral behavior as the focus of the survey, ANES actually include a diverse range of questions that captures a respondent’s social, cultural, and psychological orientations. The relative stability of questions asked in ANES, many of which span across decades, is especially helpful for those interested in how the political mind of the American public is shaped by periodical and generational forces.\nConsistent and high-quality as it is, there are also some conditions of ANES that holds back a smooth experience of exmaining long-term public opinion using this dataset. First, variables in ANES data are named with a somehow random combination of letters (usually “V”) and numbers, which suggests little information about its content at the absence of codebooks or variables labels1. This means that every time we input the original version of ANES data, we need to rename the variables of interest with the user guide’s help, and take some time to revive our memory of what each variable literally asks the respondents.\nSecond, though variables pertaining to essential political behavior like partisanship or ideology are almost asked in every survey from 1948 to 2020, a large number of variables are either relatively new or had only been asked during several releases. The official website of ANES offers continuity guides that report the timing span of a variable, but there is no standalone support in statistical softwares to report such continuity with just one click. This adds some potential frustration into our explorations of ANES since descriptive or regression analyses in R would report error or return NA values when no observation is detected."

Distinct on the national level, what are the local variations of racialized imageries of the two major parties? Combining 2016 and 2020 Cooperative Congressional Studies, this dataset details the racial compositions of Democratic and Republican partisans at the level of congressional district. For each congressional district, I break up its Republican and Democratic partisans by four racial groups: non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, blacks, and others. Considering the fact that racial composition of any party in a district is generally conditioned by racial structure of the local population, I match this dataset with American Community Survey five-year statistics on district-level racial demographics. Additional codes that connect observations to the shape files of congressional districts are also provided so that users can conveniently visualize the geographic pattern of party imageries across the United States.\nDataverse GitHub"

    "text": "Racial Compositions of Local Police Officers\nRepresentative bureaucracy, where racial composition of government employees fairly reflects the racial landscape of the population they serve, has been theorized to forge better governance due to the diverse experiences it brings into decision making, and the symbolic proximity it builds with the served public. This said, are the tensions between policing agencies and the served neighbors a result of skewed representation in their workforce? To help address questions like such, this dataset utilizes the 2016 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS), a nationally representative sample of over 3,000 law enforcement agencies across many levels. I aggregate its race-gender count of police officers at the agency level, calculate the shares of each racial group (non-Hispanic white/Hispanic/black/other), and finally measure the quality of descriptive representation by merging police agencies with the ACS demographic statistics of the places they serve. Representation of a racial group within an agency is measured by the difference between its share in police officers and its percentage in local population. Additional R codes that helps to visualize the spatial distribution of the departments sampled are also provided.\nDataverse GitHub"
