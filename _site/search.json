While existing works look into experiential and cultural differences between the two groups, this study examines the role of whites’ excessive representation in police workforce that fosters a “white imagery” of the profession. Can this racialized image of police officers activate in-group favoritism among whites but push blacks away?\nMerging the 2020 Cooperative Election Study with administrative sampling of local police departments, I find that given whites’ share of local population constant, a higher percentage of white officers in local police department is associated with more favorable feelings of police among whites, a greater black-white divide in police attitudes, and makes the white residents more tolerant of police at the presence of police violence.\n\nPDF\nHTML\nGitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the Other Side: Local Party Images and Affective Polarization\n\nSocial sorting, the situation where social groups become strongly interconnected with political parties, has been examined as a contributing factor to affective polarization in American politics. By cultivating party images represented through prominent social identities, this process instills group tensions into party politics. Yet few existing studies takes advantage of local variations of partisan composition to investigate whether the extent to which current political polarization are affected by “parties in our head”.\nThis research builds an index for party images for each congressional district using 2016 and 2020 Cooperative Election Studies, and links these local measures with 2020 American Election Studies where detailed indicators of polarization behavior are included. I find that the further the racial images of local partisans deviate from national stereotypes, the lower level of affective polarization is observed among the district’s respondents. The deviation of local party images also undermines the influence group feelings have in people’s polarization behavior. Heterogeneities by party and racial group are discussed.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak the Party Images? The Electoral Impact of Minority Republican Candidates\n\nDominantly white as the GOP is for now, the overall diversification of the U.S. population leads to a historic number of minority Republicans running for and serving in federal offices. With the Republican Party still locked with white Americans and their racial resentment, how do the emergence of these minority Republicans in congressional races enter into voters’ perceptions and condition their vote choices as partisans? And further, how do their presence challenge the status quo of party-race alignments? Drawing upon respondent’s self-reported perception of their house candidates from 2010 to 2020, I find that the perception that the GOP candidate is non-white results in a reduction in party-line voting, a lessening of partisan rigidity, but also an eroding of electoral participation.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gloom over the Mind: Prussian Rule, Cultural Persistence, and Political Liberalism in Poland\n\nCoauthor with Weihan Zhang. An emerging literature looks to historical legacies when trying to understand contemporary political divides, yet specific mechanisms remain empirically unsettled through which past institutions continuously shape political behavior over generations. Cultural or psychological persistence, which precipitates from unique, individual experiences of past generations, is often entangled with more structural mechanisms like social and economic path dependence of past institutions, making the two hard to distinguish.\nExploiting Poland’s Prussian partition in history and territory transfers after WWII, this study differentiates out the cultural persistence mechanism through within-treatment comparison. Under a spatial regression discontinuity design, our results indicate overall stronger reluctance toward political and national conservatism in former Prussian area, even after considering socioeconomic covariates. Furthermore, such liberal legacies of historical Prussian rule concentrate only on areas that didn’t experienced substantial migration following WWII, cementing a cultural mechanism.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub"

    "text": "{RaPhlot}\nR through RStudio, one of my longtime friends. Here you will find a list of resources which I believe can help you get started on your adventures with this marvelous software. It should be noted that I am including these resources with a practical rather than technical approach, which might be a little biased toward econometrics, so it is possible that people on other fields find other resources more helpful.\n\nBook: R for Data Science (R4DS) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund\n\nProbably the best introduction to the sofware that exists today. It has been endlessly recommended by all sorts of experts on R, and it is probably because it is a clear and practical guide on how to use R for all sorts of stuff (although the title says specifically data science I strongly believe this intro is fit for anybody who wants to use R). It will teach you what R is, what it isn’t and what it does best. It is a crash course on five major functions that the language has which are Wrangle, Program, Explore, Model and Communicate. However, because it is an introductory textbook, you’ll feel that it only scratches the surface on these three things. In my opinion the “wrangle” part is pretty comprehensive, but if you need more, you’ll have to go to other resources, specially for the “Communicate” part. The only difficulty you might find with this book is installing the software, but the next resource will help you with that.\n\nVideo series: Getting Started with R-Series I (and probably the rest of the channel) by Mike Marin & Ladan Hamadani\n\nA great tutorial series and overall a great YouTube channel, probably best for those that prefer learning by watching than by reading. Also, I believe that at least for installing a distribution of R and the RStudio IDE it is better to watch videos of other people doing so than reading it. The installation of the software might be one of the complications that R has compared to other software. The tutorial is done on a Mac, but as of right now I have not found that the installation process for a Windows computer is terribly different."

    "section": "Some extra advice",
    "text": "Some extra advice\nWorking with R throughout my life as a student and for my personal project, I’ve met with endless issues. I’ve been able to solve most of them by googling my question and reading other people’s Stack Overflow’s questions, or reading books. However, there have been complicated problems which have had rather difficult solutions. In this section I’d like to give some unsolicited advice for you to not run into these problems or how to solve them efficiently if you do.\n\nSurvey data and binary-outcome models\nDuring the data analysis for my capstone project, I worked extensively with survey data and eventually got to running binary-outcome models, namely logit and probit models, with the data. In the literature that used the datasets I was using, it was standard practice to run survey-weighted models to get complex sample-adjusted standard errors and adjusted coefficients. I had no trouble doing this using the survey package in R, however, I ran into trouble when I wanted to calculate average partial effects- it was impossible to do so with both the margins() or the marginaleffects() functions (both have their package named after themselves.).\nAfter much asking around and reading documentation, I found two solutions. The first one is complex and clunky, and not so effective, but it works. The whole thing is described in this Stack Overflow question that I made when I became desperate one time at 3 am.\nThe second solution is the one that definitely solved the issue and I discovered it only recently. It is possible to calculate average partial effects of the models that had given me issues in the past when I changed the data type of certain variables. Since I had imported my data from Stata files (.dat files) using the haven package, when I ran class() on certain variables I found that it had double as the data type. I found that changing the data type to integer or numeric using the as.* functions solved the issue, now, running marginaleffects() on the model objects with the updated variables caused no issues. A certainly strange problem; I might write about it on the Posts section and/or contribute to LOST with this info."
