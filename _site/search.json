While existing works look into experiential and cultural differences between the two groups, this study examines the role of whites’ excessive representation in police workforce that fosters a “white imagery” of the profession. Can this racialized image of police officers activate in-group favoritism among whites but push blacks away?\nMerging the 2020 Cooperative Election Study with administrative sampling of local police departments, I find that given whites’ share of local population constant, a higher percentage of white officers in local police department is associated with more favorable feelings of police among whites, a greater black-white divide in police attitudes, and makes the white residents more tolerant of police at the presence of police violence.\n\nPDF\nHTML\nGitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the Other Side: Local Party Images and Affective Polarization\n\nSocial sorting, the situation where social groups become strongly interconnected with political parties, has been examined as a contributing factor to affective polarization in American politics. By cultivating party images represented through prominent social identities, this process instills group tensions into party politics. Yet few existing studies takes advantage of local variations of partisan composition to investigate whether the extent to which current political polarization are affected by “parties in our head”.\nThis research builds an index for party images for each congressional district using 2016 and 2020 Cooperative Election Studies, and links these local measures with 2020 American Election Studies where detailed indicators of polarization behavior are included. I find that the further the racial images of local partisans deviate from national stereotypes, the lower level of affective polarization is observed among the district’s respondents. The deviation of local party images also undermines the influence group feelings have in people’s polarization behavior. Heterogeneities by party and racial group are discussed.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak the Party Images? The Electoral Impact of Minority Republican Candidates\n\nDominantly white as the GOP is for now, the overall diversification of the U.S. population leads to a historic number of minority Republicans running for and serving in federal offices. With the Republican Party still locked with white Americans and their racial resentment, how do the emergence of these minority Republicans in congressional races enter into voters’ perceptions and condition their vote choices as partisans? And further, how do their presence challenge the status quo of party-race alignments? Drawing upon respondent’s self-reported perception of their house candidates from 2010 to 2020, I find that the perception that the GOP candidate is non-white results in a reduction in party-line voting, a lessening of partisan rigidity, but also an eroding of electoral participation.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gloom over the Mind: Prussian Rule, Cultural Persistence, and Political Liberalism in Poland\n\nCoauthor with Weihan Zhang. An emerging literature looks to historical legacies when trying to understand contemporary political divides, yet specific mechanisms remain empirically unsettled through which past institutions continuously shape political behavior over generations. Cultural or psychological persistence, which precipitates from unique, individual experiences of past generations, is often entangled with more structural mechanisms like social and economic path dependence of past institutions, making the two hard to distinguish.\nExploiting Poland’s Prussian partition in history and territory transfers after WWII, this study differentiates out the cultural persistence mechanism through within-treatment comparison. Under a spatial regression discontinuity design, our results indicate overall stronger reluctance toward political and national conservatism in former Prussian area, even after considering socioeconomic covariates. Furthermore, such liberal legacies of historical Prussian rule concentrate only on areas that didn’t experienced substantial migration following WWII, cementing a cultural mechanism.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub"

Yet what is usually ignored or confused in this line of identity shift research is the temporal structure where politically motivated changing of identities takes place. It is one thing that long-time, consistent partisans alter their identities in accordance to prototypical partisans, and another when unstable party identifiers switch their group labels in order to match their changing politics. Building upon early insights from the American Voter, this study proposes a static-versus-dynamic framework of identity shift under political influence. I utilize a five-wave panel dataset to show that both kinds of identity shift exist among American partisans yet differ in terms of their magnitudes and the populations they impact.\n\nPDF HTML GitHub"

Currently I am a senior of Philosophy, Politics and Economics1 at Peking University. I also go by Raphael, my Catholic name.\nBroadly interested in race and ethnic politics and political behavior in the realm of American politics, I study the dynamics between racial identities and political polarization. My research examines how racial imageries—people’s racialized imagination of politically relevant categories—shape people’s perception of politics, and drive a diversifying America toward affective as well as ideological extremes. To accurately capture the content of racial imageries and their political implications, I draw upon an extensive range of data sources including public opinion surveys, census data, and administrative records."

Distinct on the nationwide level, what are the local variations of racialized imageries of the two major parties? Combining 2016 and 2020 Cooperative Congressional Studies, this dataset details the racial compositions of Democratic and Republican partisans at the level of congressional district. For each congressional district, I break up its Republican and Democratic partisans by four racial groups: non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, blacks, and others. Considering the fact that racial composition of any party in a district is generally conditioned by the racial structure of the local population, I match this dataset with American Community Survey five-year statistics on district-level racial demographics. Additional codes that connect observations to the shape files of congressional districts are also provided so that users can conveniently visualize the geographic pattern of party imageries across the United States.\nDataverse GitHub"

    "text": "Racial Compositions of Local Police Officers\nRepresentative bureaucracy, where the racial composition of government employees fairly reflects the racial landscape of the population they work to serve, has been theorized to foster better governance due to the diverse experiences it brings into decision making, and the symbolic proximity it builds with the served public. This said, are the tensions between policing agencies and the served neighbors a result of skewed representation in their workforce? To help address questions like such, this dataset utilizes the 2016 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS), a nationally representative sample of over 3,000 law enforcement agencies across many levels. I aggregate its race-gender count of police officers at the agency level, calculate the shares of each racial group (non-Hispanic white/Hispanic/black/other), and finally measure its descriptive representation quality by merging the agencies with the ACS demographic statistics of the locality it serves. Representation of a racial group within an agency is approached by the difference between its share in police officers and its percentage in local population. Additional R codes that helps to visualize the spatial distribution of the departments sampled are also provided.\nDataverse GitHub"
