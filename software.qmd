<!-- Along my journey of learning and reseaching quantitative social sciences with `R` and other tools, I have been substantially benefiting from the vibrant, creative, and generous vibes of open source communities. From detecting coding errors for a stranger half a globe afar to devotedly developing useful packages regardless of material returns, these daily practices among open-source programmers shed light on the best facet of human nature and build up a hopeful, inspiring vision of our world. Once in a while I feel the urge to give back by sharing my own coding. Here are some of the software and resources that I developed with the wish that it may ease your burden when conducting public opinion research. -->
