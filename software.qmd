Here I have compiled a list or a commented bibliography, if you will, of resources that I have found useful along the course of my academic studies. By no means I am an expert on these topics but I do believe that these will help some people out. All efforts that I've dedicated to this page are dedicated to the memory of my grandfather, Jorge Pazmi√±o. Do not hesitate to contact me for suggestions and comments about these.
