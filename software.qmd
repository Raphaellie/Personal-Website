American National Election Studies (ANES) is probably the most authentic survey used in studies of American political behavior. The continuity and consistency of cumulative ANES data across years make it a useful window for public opinion scholars to observe long-term transformations of American politics at the individual level. Yet this process could get a little bumpy because of the absence of particular variables in particular waves. I developed this `R` package to help you painlessly track the trends of not only individual variables but associations between them. Check [this post](/posts/RaPhlot/index.qmd) for how to use `{RaPhlot}` to ease your explorations of ANES data.
