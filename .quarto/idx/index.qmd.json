Welcome to my personal website!]{.lead}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-0 .g-col-md-2}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-10}\nI grew up in an industrial town in Chongqing, China, and went to Beijing for my undergraduate education. Currently I am a senior student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics[^1] at Peking University. I also go by Raphael, my Catholic name.\n\nBroadly interested in race and ethnic politics and political behavior in the realm of American politics, I study the dynamics between racial identities and political polarization. My research examines how racial imageries---people's racialized imagination of politically relevant categories---shape people's perception of politics, and drive a diversifying America toward affective as well as ideological extremes. To accurately capture the content of racial imageries and their political implications, I draw upon an extensive range of data sources including public opinion surveys, census data, and administrative records.\n\nA passionate `r fa('r-project',fill = 'navy')` user[^2], I enjoy applying powerful packages provided by the `R` community to visualize cross-sectional and time-series patterns of American political behavior in both static and interactive forms. I do this mostly for fun but also to help myself uncover interesting modes in American politics that otherwise might be elusive to spot. Check some of the graphs I proudly made with the help of `{tidyverse}` in the [Gaphics](graphics.qmd) page.\n\n## Education `r fa(\"graduation-cap\")`\n\n-   BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) \\| July 2023 \\| **Peking University**\n-   Exchange Student, ASAP Parterships \\| December 2021 \\| **University of Notre Dame**\n\n## Research Interests `r fa('book-open-reader')`\n\n::: columns\n::: column\n-   American Politics\n-   Race and Ethnic Politics (REP)\n-   Political Behavior\n-   Public Opinion\n:::\n\n::: column\n-   Politics of Identity\n-   Racial Imagery\n-   Social Cleavage\n-   Partisanship\n-   Affective Polarization\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n[^1]: Rather than three individual majors as it may confusingly sound like, Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) is actually one combined, interdisciplinary major that [originates from the University of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy,_politics_and_economics) in the 1920s.\n\n[^2]: `r fa('r-project',fill = 'navy')` is actually such a powerhouse that I can almost conduct finish every stage of a research project entirely within the environment of `RStudio` , from data cleaning to in-depth analyses to writing the final manuscript! And despite my unapologetic love for R, I did set out my journey of quantitative social science in the arms of `Stata`, which I still use once in while for its stability and clarity in inspecting and labeling data.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","editor":"visual","theme":["lumen","light.scss"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
