I grew up in an industrial town in Chongqing, China before going to Beijing for my undergraduate education. Currently I am a senior student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Peking University. I also go by Raphael, my Catholic name. Broadly interested in race and ethnic politics and political behavior in the realm of American politics, I study the dynamics between racial identities and political polarization. My research examines how racial imageries---people's racialized imagination of politically relevant categories---shape people's perception of politics, and drive a diversifying America toward affective as well as ideological extremes. To accurately capture the content of racial imageries and their political implications, I draw upon an extensive range of data sources including public opinion surveys, census data, and administrative records.\n\n[{{< fa user >}} CV](assets/cv/Wang-CV.pdf){.badge .bg-info style=\"text-decoration: none;\"} [{{< fa envelope >}} Email](mailto:chyrwang@gmail.com){.badge .bg-info style=\"text-decoration: none;\"} [{{< fa brands twitter >}} Twitter](https://twitter.com/raphael_cwang){.badge .bg-info style=\"text-decoration: none;\"} [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/Raphaellie){.badge .bg-info style=\"text-decoration: none;\"}\n\n\n-   **Areas** \\| American Politics, Racial and Ethnic Politics (REP), Political Behavior\n-   **Topics** \\| Politics of Identity, Social Cleavage, Partisanship, Affective Polarization\n\n### Education\n\n-   B.A. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics \\| June 2023 \\| **Peking University**\n-   Exchange Student, ASAP Parterships \\| December 2021 \\| **University of Notre Dame**\n\n### Working Papers\n\n::: {#working-papers}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","editor":"visual","theme":"lumen","linkcolor":"$primary","fontsize":"100%","listing":{"id":"working-papers","contents":"working-papers","template":"paper-list.ejs"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
