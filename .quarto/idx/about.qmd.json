I am currently a senior student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Peking University. With a regional focus on American politics, my current interest lays at the intersection between partisan attachments and a broader range of social identities, principally race and ethnicity. Specifically, I am concerned about: first, how social processes and cognitive mechanisms, combined with historical contexts, can furnish identities that are by content apolitical with political meanings; second, how individuals perceive and react to their everyday life, be it political or not, through a lens of racial identities and racial relations.\n:::\n\n<div>\n\nAs put by [Professor Daniel M. Gim√©nez](https://twitter.com/Ego_Ipse), R is my copilot - I became passionate about data analysis and visualization using R during my undergraduate studies in econometrics, and I've been using R as much as I can ever since.\n\n</div>\n\n## Education `r fa(\"graduation-cap\")`\n\n-   BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) \\| expected 2023 \\| **Peking University**\n\n## Research Interets `r fa('book-open-reader')`\n\n::: columns\n::: column\n<!-- #### Area -->\n\n-   American Politics\n-   Race and Ethnic Politics (REP)\n-   Political Behavior\n-   Public Opinion\n:::\n\n::: column\n<!-- #### Topic -->\n\n-   Politics of Identity\n-   Racial Imagery\n-   Social Cleavage\n-   Partisanship\n-   Affective Polarization\n:::\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","editor":"visual","theme":["journal","custom.scss"],"title":"Chaoyue R.
