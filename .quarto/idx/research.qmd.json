I'm interested in the relationship between racial identities and political behavior in the context of American Politics. Specifically, my research revolves around the two bundles of questions:\n\n-   **Identities** {{< fa right-long >}} **Politics:** How racial identities shape the ways people perceive and respond to the political world? Through what mechanisms---cultural, psychological, and institutional--are racial identities endowed with political implications? What will the current political polarization look like when construed through a perspective that centers on the role of racial identities?\n\n-   **Politics** {{< fa right-long >}} **Identities:** How do people's politics mold their social identities in return? How do people reconcile the tensions between their political and social selves? For people embodying unusual combinations of politics and identities, like black Republicans or white Evangelical Democrats, which side will triumph in this internal struggle? Or is there a struggle at all?\n\n\nI believe that research should be as reproducible as possible, so I try to always publish my source code for all my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/dsanchezp18) and [RPubs](https://github.com/dsanchezp18) sites. Further, along with very good academics at LIDE, I work on research and projects that can help the development of my home country, Ecuador. Some of the work that I've done with LIDE can be seen below or also at the organization's blog, [El Quantificador](https://elquantificador.org/).\n\n## Working Papers\n\n### Blues in Colors: Police Violence, Racial Representation, and White Attitude Change\n\n-   Sánchez Pazmiño, D.
