Hi there! I grew up in an industrial town in Chongqing, China before going to Beijing for my undergraduate education. Currently I am a senior student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Peking University. I also go by Raphael, my Catholic name. Broadly interested in race and ethnic politics and political behavior in the realm of American politics, I study the dynamics between racial identities and political polarization. My research examines how racial imageries---people's racialized imagination of politically relevant categories---shape people's perception of politics, and drive a diversifying America toward affective as well as ideological extremes. To accurately capture the content of racial imageries and their political implications, I draw upon an extensive range of data sources including public opinion surveys, census data, and administrative records.
