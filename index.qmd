### Hi There!

I grew up in an industrial town in Chongqing, China, and went to Beijing for my undergraduate education. Currently I am a senior of Philosophy, Politics and Economics[^1] at Peking University. I also go by Raphael, my Catholic name.

[^1]: Rather than three individual majors as it may confusingly sound like, Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) is actually one combined, interdisciplinary major that [originates from the University of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy,_politics_and_economics) in the 1920s.

Broadly interested in race and ethnic politics and political behavior in the realm of American politics, I study the dynamics between racial identities and political polarization. My research examines how racial imageries---people's racialized imagination of politically relevant categories---shape people's perception of politics, and drive a diversifying America toward affective as well as ideological extremes. To accurately capture the content of racial imageries and their political implications, I draw upon an extensive range of data sources including public opinion surveys, census data, and administrative records.

A passionate `r fa('r-project',fill = 'navy')` user[^2], I enjoy applying powerful packages provided by the `R` community to visualize cross-sectional and time-series patterns of American political behavior in both static and interactive forms. I do this mostly for fun but also to help myself uncover interesting modes in American politics that otherwise might be elusive to spot. Check some of the graphs I proudly made with the help of `{tidyverse}` in the [Gaphics](graphics.qmd) page.

[^2]: `r fa('r-project',fill = 'navy')` is actually such a powerhouse that I can almost conduct finish every stage of a research project entirely within the environment of `RStudio` , from data cleaning to in-depth analyses to writing the final manuscript! And despite my unapologetic love for R, I did set out my journey of quantitative social science in the arms of `Stata`, which I still use once in while for its stability and clarity in inspecting and labeling data.
