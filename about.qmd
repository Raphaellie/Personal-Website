## Bio

I grew up in an industrial neighborhood in Chongqing, China, and then went to Beijing for my undergraduate education. I am currently a senior student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Peking University. With a regional focus on American politics, my current interest lays at the intersection between partisan attachments and a broader range of social identities, principally race and ethnicity. Specifically, I am concerned about: first, how social processes and cognitive mechanisms, combined with historical contexts, can furnish identities that are by content apolitical with political meanings; second, how individuals perceive and react to their everyday life, be it political or not, through a lens of racial identities and racial relations.

As put by [Professor Daniel M. Gim√©nez](https://twitter.com/Ego_Ipse), R is my copilot - I became passionate about data analysis and visualization using R during my undergraduate studies in econometrics, and I've been using R as much as I can ever since.
